# Popular Movies

**Popular Movies** is an Android app that shows you the the latest
popular movies from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) website.

The application is part of Udacity's [Google Associate Android Developer Fast Track](https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818).
It's purpose is to teach the students how to build a modern Android app
(e.g. which patterns to use, material design, how to be energy
efficient, etc).

You can find my version of the **Popular Movies** here. It is work in
progress, and it is built for education purposes only. If you need a
more sophisticated, finalized solution, I recommend [Dmitry Malkovich](https://github.com/DmitryMalkovich/popular-movies-app)'s
or [Emin Yahyayev](https://github.com/ewintory/udacity-popular-movies)'s version of the app.

## Coding Style

There is no perfect coding guidelines except the one that everybody in
your team follows. I follow [Futurice's Android Best Practices](https://github.com/futurice/android-best-practices)
except that I use [CodePath's recommended directory structure](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Organizing-your-Source-Files).

## How to contribute

Thank you, but please do not contribute. :) The app is part of the
course evaluation process thus it should contain my work only.
Nevertheless, you can open an issue if you think there are things which
needs to be improved. I appreciate if you teach me.
